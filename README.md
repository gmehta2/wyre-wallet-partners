# Intro
This Repo contains source code for Wyre landing pages for partners. If the partner uses a web3 wallet, each page is designed to connect to the corresponding wallet to allow its users a rapid, easy way to buy crypto directly into their wallet. 

# Adding Your Partner page
Any Wyre partner can create a sendwyre landing page with a simple pull request. Please let the Wyre team know that you intend to create a landing page, and make a pull request following these steps:

Uploads: 
1) Add the background image for your landing page as a .png file in `/src/Assets/PartnerBackgrounds` following the naming convention: `partner-name-background.png`.
2) Add your logo as a `.png` or `.svg` file in `/src/Assets/PartnerLogos` following the naming convention: `partner-name-logo.[png/svg]`.
3) Add your favicon as a `.ico` file in `/src/Assets/PartnerFavicons` following the naming convention: `partner-name-favicon.ico`. We generally recommend creating this `.ico` file by uploading a transparent logo to the [favicon.io converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).

Config: 

4) Import your background, logo, and favicon into `/src/config.js` as instructed in the file comments.
5) Add your url as a config object with your preferred configurations, following the example available in the config file.

Connecting a wallet (web3 wallet partners only):

6) Update `/Components/Connectors.js` to include a [web3-react](https://noahzinsmeister.gitbook.io/web3-react/v/latest/connectors) connector for your project. If a connector does not exist for your project, see documentation on [writing a custom web3-react connector](https://noahzinsmeister.gitbook.io/web3-react/v/latest/custom-connectors) (and consider making a pull request on web3-react to add it to the official list!).

7) Finally, confirm with the Wyre team who will review your pull request. Once your pull request is merged, your landing page will be live at https://partners.sendwyre.com/#[your-landing-page].
